Trying to learn and understand PCA using oF

This is an ongoing work and learning process. 
My goal is to include a number of soft metrics for each recognized person.

Current Status:
Face Recognition is working.
Eulerian Video Magnification is working but still needs a lot of work to detect pulse.


This is where i want to go in the future, maybe ill start a new project folder for this or continue here.
Any suggestions or collaboration is welcome. Just drop me a mail: rasmus at schnitzel dot dk
